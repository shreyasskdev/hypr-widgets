# Hypr Widgets

Widgets for **Hyprland** using [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags).

## Description

A collection of widgets for the **Hyprland** Wayland compositor made with **AGS**.
Includes a Desktop clock, sidebar, and a charging animation.

## Features

- **Desktop Clock**: A simple clock to display the time.
- **Sidebar**: A customizable sidebar showing system information.
- **Charging Animation**: Displays an animation when charger is plugged in.

## Dependencies

- **Hyprland** (Wayland compositor)
- **AGS**
- **GTK 4**
- **pywal16**

> **Warning**: Make sure you have **pywal16** installed and properly configured to generate colors. The widgets rely on the color scheme generated by **pywal16**, so ensure it is set up before using the widgets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your configuration directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shreyasskdev/hypr-widgets.git ~/.config/ags
    ```

2. Enable shaders with animation in your **Hyprland** configuration. This step is necessary because, for now, shaders with animation are required.

    ```bash
    # Debug settings
    debug {
        damage_tracking = false
    }
    ```

    **Note**: If you already have shaders enabled in your Hyprland setup, this may cause a conflict. Ensure to resolve any potential conflicts accordingly.


## Running the Widgets

Once everything is set up, you can run the widgets with:

```bash
ags run --gtk4
```
